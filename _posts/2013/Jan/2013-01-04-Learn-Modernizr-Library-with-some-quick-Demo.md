If you are reading this article you might already know what Modernizr has to offer but the post aims to give you some working demo instead of a content based approach. If you are looking for a documentation it isavailable on their website and it offers a step-by-step guide. But while using it, I have found that there was a lack of demo that how to really use its features in real world, so, I thought of creating a demowhich you can fork it and keep it for your own reference.
