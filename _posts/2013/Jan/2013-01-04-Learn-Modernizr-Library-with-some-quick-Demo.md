If you are reading this article you might already know what <a href="http://modernizr.com/" target="_blank">Modernizr</a> has to offer but the post aims to give you some working demo instead of a content based approach. If you are looking for a documentation it is&nbsp;available on their website and it offers a step-by-step guide. But while using it, I have found that there was a lack of demo that how to really use its features in real world, so, I thought of creating a <a href="http://codepen.io/siddharth-pandey/full/JbKhC" target="_blank">demo</a>&nbsp;which you can fork it and keep it for your own reference.
