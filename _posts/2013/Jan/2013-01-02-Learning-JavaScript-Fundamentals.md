I was about to start a project which is heavily based on JavaScript. I thought it will be a good approach if I also start learning JavaScript fundamentals for my bad memory! And thought, if I am learning something from scratch, I should write it somewhere for me and for others. Though from scratch, but this series fo learning JavaScript fundamentals will be jump start tutorial. I will try to cover all the basic stuff. Let us start now.

Below you may find the links to all the part of this series:
- [An Introduction to JavaScript](http://siddharth-pandey.github.io/2013/01/02/An-Introduction-to-JavaScript/)
- [The Building Blocks of JavaScript Programs](http://siddharth-pandey.github.io/2013/01/04/The-Building-Blocks-of-JavaScript-Programs/)

Be patient to go through above topics. Hope this series will help you to learn one of the scripting languages that many developers enjoy! :)
