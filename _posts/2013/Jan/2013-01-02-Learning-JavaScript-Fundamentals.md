I was about to start a project which isheavily based on JavaScript. I thought it will be a good approach if I also start learning JavaScript fundamentals for my bad memory! And thought, if I am learning something from scratch, I should write it somewhere for me and for others. Though from scratch, but this series fo learning JavaScript fundamentals will be jump start tutorial. I will try to cover all the basic stuff. Let us start now. Below you may find the links to all the part of this series: An Introduction to JavaScript The Building Blocks of JavaScript Programs Functions Control Flow Types Libraries Firebug Testing JavaScript. Be patient to go through above topics. Hope this series will help you to learn one of the scriptinglanguages that many developers enjoy! :)
